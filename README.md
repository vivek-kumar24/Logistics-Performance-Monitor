#Logistics Performance Monitor
Link to challenge: https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/5
A data-driven dashboard designed to analyse and track key fulfilment metrics—On-Time (OT), In-Full (IF), and On-Time-In-Full (OTIF)—to evaluate supply-chain performance, identify bottlenecks, and support operational decision-making.

#Problem Statement

A rapidly expanding FMCG company based in Gujarat, India, currently operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, with plans to scale into additional metro and Tier-1 cities within the next two years.

However, the business has recently encountered service-related challenges. Several major customers chose not to renew their annual contracts, reportedly due to recurring delivery issues—specifically, orders not arriving on time or not being fulfilled completely. These repeated lapses likely affected customer satisfaction and raised concerns about the company’s operational reliability.

To address this, the management has tasked the supply chain analytics team with closely monitoring fulfilment performance. They require daily tracking of ‘On-Time’ and ‘In-Full’ delivery service levels across all customers, enabling quick identification and resolution of service disruptions.

The supply chain team has adopted a standard methodology to measure performance: calculating the daily On-Time Delivery (OT %), In-Full Delivery (IF %), and On-Time-In-Full (OTIF %) against the service-level targets defined for each customer.

#Task

You are stepping into the role of Peter Pandey, a newly hired data analyst on the supply chain team at the company. After attending the stakeholder business review meeting, you have been assigned the responsibility of developing a performance monitoring dashboard. As the analyst, your tasks include:

Building all required performance metrics based on the provided metric definitions.

Designing and developing a dashboard that aligns with the expectations outlined during the stakeholder meeting. A comic-style transcript of the meeting will be provided for reference.

Discovering and presenting additional meaningful insights that go beyond the metrics list or the stakeholder instructions.

###Key Metrics Tracked
1. On-Time (OT)
Measures whether an order arrived on or before the expected date.

2. In-Full (IF)
Checks whether the entire ordered quantity was delivered.

3. OTIF (On-Time-In-Full)
Evaluates orders that were delivered both on time and in full—a crucial indicator of customer satisfaction and supply-chain reliability.

#Important Insights from the Dashboard
-Average OT%, IF%, and OTIF% are noticeably lower than the targeted levels.
-Acclaimed Stores, Lotus Mart, Vijay Stores, Rel Fresh, Cool Blue, and Propel Mart seem to be the key customers as they have almost 53% of the total orders.
-On May 22 and Aug 22 there is a slight improvement in IF% and OTIF% but still they are very far from the target.
-The Total orders for AM milk 250 are the most still a lot of times it is delayed.
-OTIF% for Acclaimed Stores-15.47% , Lotus Mart-16.34% , Cool Blue-13.75% which is quite alarming.
-Also OTIF for acclaimed stores which have the most orders out of all customers in Surat is only 6.93%
-out of 32k orders only 9.2k orders are delivered on time in full.
